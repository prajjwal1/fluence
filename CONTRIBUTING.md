Thanks for thinking for bringing contributions to this project. Since this is an early stage project, there are currently no well laid out guidelines on sending PRs.
Few things to keep in mind:
1. If the issue is small, send a PR directly
2. If the issue is big, please file an issue first
3. Run `make style` and `make quality` to perform code formatting
4. Run tests with `pytest tests/`
